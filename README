Address File:
    The address file is a file which contains ip addresses or hostnames, one per line.  For example:

addresses:
127.0.0.1
127.0.0.2
localhost

Config File:
    The config file is a file used to define the log files to search for addresses.

Ip address wildcards:
	Groups of IP addresses can be searched for by leaving out poritions of the address. 
	For example '--ip=127.0.0.' will search for all ip addresses beginning with '127.0.0.' 
	Note: In this case, hostname searching is not performed.
